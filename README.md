# Alarm-Clock
Tkinter GUI project for timekeeping

A simple alarm clock GUI project that I worked on to improve coding habits,improve my knowledge of tkinter and pygame modules, and utilize a database. When complete, this will be a fully functioning program similar to the "Clock" app on Android or its iOS equivalent. It has support for a local digital clock, a stopwatch, alarms, and a timer at the moment. Further improvements to the alarms is my next task. I seek to add customizable messages, sounds, and repeat settings.

## How to Use
### Full Program
Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no executable package to run with a single click or without python installed. After cloning or downloading the repository, you can begin. After having the latest stable version of Python 3 installed, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the command "python -m alarm-clock" if on Windows, or "python3 -m alarm-clock" if on Mac or Linux.

### Digital Clock
To run the digital clock program, after having the latest stable version of Python 3 installed and the repository cloned or downloaded, navigate to the root folder of the repository "Alarm-Clock", then run the command "python alarm-clock\clock.py" if on Windows, or "python3 alarm-clock/clock.py" if on Linux or Mac.

### Alarms
To run the alarms program, after having the latest stable version of Python 3 installed and the repository cloned or downloaded, navigate to the root folder of the repository "Alarm-Clock", then run the command "python alarm-clock\alarms.py" if on Windows, or "python3 alarm-clock/alarms.py" if on Linux or Mac.

### Stopwatch
To run the stopwatch program, after having the latest stable version of Python 3 installed and the repository cloned or downloaded, navigate to the root folder of the repository "Alarm-Clock", then run the command "python alarm-clock\stopwatch.py" if on Windows, or "python3 alarm-clock/stopwatch.py" if on Linux or Mac.

### Timer
To run the timer program, after having the latest stable version of Python 3 installed and the repository cloned or downloaded, navigate to the root folder of the repository "Alarm-Clock", then run the command "python alarm-clock\timer.py" if on Windows, or "python3 alarm-clock/timer.py" if on Linux or Mac.
